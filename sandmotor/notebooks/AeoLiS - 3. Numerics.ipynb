    "\n",
    "In AeoLiS timescales are used to parameterize two decay processes that are relevant to coastal aeolian sediment transport. The first timescale is the adaptation timescale `T` in the advection equation that determines the rate of pickup in downwind direction when transport is not saturated. The second timescale is the drying timescale `Tdry` in the soil moisture model that determines the drying of the soil after inundation.\n",

    "## 3.2 Drag partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "The influence of large non-erodible elements (e.g. shells) on a sandy bed extends beyond the area that is covered by a particular element. Shadow effects in the lee of a non-erodible element cause the local wind shear to be lowered, resulting in a decrease in aeolian sediment transport capacity. This shadow effect is referred to as drag partitioning and included in AeoLiS through the Raupach (1993) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raupach (1993) defines the parameters `sigma`, `beta` and `m` for parameterizing the drag partitioning in terms of a roughness density `lambda`. Mathematically `sigma` and `beta` only appear in the implementation of AeoLiS as a ratio and therefore essentially represent a single parameter. `m` is either 0.5 or 1.0 depending on whether you are dealing with a lab or field situation.\n",

    "## 3.3 Bed interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "For the numerical implementation of multi-fraction sediment transport a distribution of grain size fraction for the erosion and deposition is needed. For hydrodynamic models the grain size distribution in the local bed cell is typically used as distribution. The advantage of such approach is that it is fairly trivial to implement. The disadvantage of this approach is that fine grains cannot easily pass a patch of coarse grains or vice versa, which hampers the development of spatial variations in bed composition. Although this disadvantage might be acceptable for hydrodynamic processes, it poses significant limitations for modeling aeolian sediment transport processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In AeoLiS the grain size distribution for sediment erosion and deposition depends on both the grain size distribution in the bed and in the air. The bed interaction factor weighs both distribution to obtain the grain size distribution for erosion and deposition. A bed interaction factor of zero means that, in case of saturated transport, sediment can pass without interaction with the bed. A value of one means that the continuation of transport depends entirely on the grain size distribution in the bed.\n",

    "\n",
    "In AeoLiS hydrodynamics are only used to determine beach width and wave reworking of the bed.\n",
